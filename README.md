# LaTeX-Examples
This repository contains LaTeX source files that can be used as examples, or templates, for different types of MSL document.

The document `Install MikTeX etc.pdf` may be helpful if you are setting up LaTeX on your computer for the first time. The `localtex.zip` files can help to set up the usual internal LaTeX folder structure.
